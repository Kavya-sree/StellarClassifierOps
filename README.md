# StellarClassifierOps

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to classify stars based on their spectral characteristics. The goal is to develop a robust workflow using MLOps principles to manage data ingestion, data transformation, model training and evaluation.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying celestial objects—stars, galaxies, and quasars—using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17. The classification leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and categorize spectral and photometric data, contributing to a deeper understanding of the universe's structure and evolution.

## Astronomical Context

**What is Stellar Classification?**

Stellar classification involves categorizing stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral properties and physical characteristics. This helps in studying their composition, lifecycle, and role in cosmic evolution.

**Relevance to Astronomy**

Stars: Understanding stellar types reveals information about their temperature, age, and chemical makeup.
Galaxies: Studying galaxy types helps in exploring their formation, structure, and interaction in clusters.
Quasars: High-energy active galactic nuclei, quasars, serve as probes of the distant universe.
 
**About the SDSS DR17 Dataset**

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is a comprehensive astronomical survey that provides high-quality spectra and imaging for millions of celestial objects. DR17 is its latest release, offering improved data reduction techniques and expanded catalogs for stars, galaxies, and quasars.
